[00:00:00],DB:,"Well, let's put it right there.  And that one, it has like an auto level so that should work and I can see it.  So that's nice.  Usually I get really nervous about 30 minutes in.  Is it going?  One time, one wasn't going which really made me anxious.  That's why I have two.",
,SS:,So these are the questions?,
,DB:,"Yeah, these are the questions and it's pretty open-ended.  There are sort of a couple of parts to it.  The first part is the very sort of meant to be quickly going through your current practices for your digital files.  It's a survey that I've done online with a bunch of emerging writers and they are asking all the participants in this as well and then we'll talk kind of specifically about your writing process, which is probably the majority.  There are questions about computing and computers.  Usually we cover those but sometimes, I go through those a little bit too if we have gone through those things and I want to ask a few more.  Does that sound okay?  Do you have to go somewhere or anything?",career
,,Everyone has been an hour 15 to an hour 45 right in there.  So if you would please state for the recording devices your name and our location.,career
,SS:,"Stephanie Strickland, New York City.",career
,DB:,What genres do you write in?,career
,SS:,"I do books of poetry and I write critical essays, and I write--and I make--usually collaboratively born-digital works.",career
,DB:,Would you say you have a primary genre?,career
,SS:,Poetry.,career
,DB:,What kind of devices do you own or have access to for your writing?,career
,SS:,"Pens, pencils.",career
,,"There are four computing devices in this one room.  I keep an old XP Machine going, with difficulty these days. I liked Word 2003.  I managed to get that and Word 2007 on the XP machine, and then I have a small Acer, which is actually probably the most advanced machine, but again, Word 2007 is on there and I write with that.  The Acer is for travel and then since the last thing I made was an app for iPad, I was forced to buy an iPad. That's over there, a mini.",career
,,But I do not write on it.,career
,DB:,How do you work between all these devices?,career
,SS:,"Well, if I'm generating new material, I will certainly do a certain amount of writing by hand.  I capture at various points the material in a Word processing program.  The one I work with most intuitively is Word 2003.  I'm annoyed at all the extra, ridiculous functionality in newer versions.",
,DB:,"At least there is no clippie, right?",
,SS:,"Yeah, I mean there's too much. It's not directed for what I want to do and it doesn't handle other things like Photoshop.",
,,"But nonetheless, it's not supported anymore, as with so much of the software that I once used.  So I capture the work at different points--certainly capturing it online is much better for sharing it and editing it to a degree, but capturing it there is not particularly good for through line.",
,DB:,What do you mean by that?,revision
,SS:,"Well, if you're writing something long with a complex argument, I think it's much easier to have it in front of you in paper and read it out because it's very easy to go into a collage-y kind of style of stuff with stuff that's going to be published online.  It's harder to get a long consecutive argument made, and it's not fluid enough to do poetry.  I mean, it restricts you way too much in terms of formatting compared to what you can do on a page by hand, in terms of how you want to scratch things out or put something right in there--There's no arrow, insert, none of what you can do by hand.  So there's a loss from both perspectives, but obviously from the point of organizing the work and sharing it and sending it on for publishing these days and everything, it has to be done on a computer. It took me a long time to get there though because I started on a manual typewriter and then getting an IBM typewriter was a big thing, you know, I mean I've used many, many writing technologies.",revision
,DB:,That's really the impetus for this project. This is a very interesting time for writing poetry.,revision
,SS:,"Well, I remember those little balls on the IBM electric--that was this huge thing, that you could erase with an erase mechanism.  I mean, you didn't have to pull the page out and start all over again.  On the other hand, there was a discipline about that.  So each technology gave rise to a certain kind of poetry and certain kind of mystique. I mean these characteristic mistakes, people make in email or characteristic word substitutions that you can do that you never did on the page--",revision
,,"Anyway, I don't think that story has really been told because it shifts so rapidly because you went from email to texting, to this to that, you know, and each one of those things has a different effect. And then Facebook sits up there and shifts its interface monthly or whatever it does, and that gives rise to a whole new thing.  In the meantime, whatever a person might have wanted to do is kind of knocked out of their head because they are left wrestling with the interface.",revision
,DB:,"So in terms of going between your paperwork and going to the digital look, what steps does that entail?",revision
,SS:,"It's different.  Every single project is completely different. For instance, if I'm doing a conference presentation, I would tend to generate something and then send it to my partner to see what he or she wants to say about it, and then we get together face to face and deal with that or whatever.",revision
,,"The last really big new book I did, Dragon Logic--the way I wrote that was for six months, every morning, I had some paper notebooks and old notes I was looking through and I would sit and I would write every morning for maybe three or four hours and at the end of the morning, I would go and type that up. I would input it.",revision
,,"I did not look at it again.  The next day would start completely fresh, and I did that to the point that I had no idea how it had begun actually.  And maybe six months later, I came to the end of that and then it was a matter of looking back and asking myself, ""What is it?"" So then there was a long period of making a unity of some kind out of it.  And that shifted; it had maybe two or three major shifts in understanding as I went through it. but I really liked it because it was very new to me to go back and look at it.  I mean, I had really no idea.",revision
,DB:,"You don't know, yeah.",revision
,SS:,"So there was a long period of writing. Sometimes I've gone to writing colonies and written straight through for a long, long time and not input the work until I returned from the colony. But then there was a time when I still had a car at that time and   I wasn't living in the city and I put my IBM selectric or whatever in and carry it out or I would rent a computer to have at that place because I wanted the print out, and I still want the print out.  It looks different to me on paper than it does on the screen, and you want to know both those aspects.",revision
,,"And then there came the time when no one did that anymore.  You couldn't really rent a computer. It was the same time when you would go to make presentations and whenever you went the university had a computer there, in a room, with a stage, and you needed a technician to come and fix up all the cords and whatever, and then, they didn't anymore because everyone was expected to bring their laptop and to have one, and to travel with it.  I had a lot of problems with my hands from when I first started doing digital work and I travel really, really light so that made me really angry that I had to carry that weight, and I wouldn't.  I would borrow somebody's computer or something like that.  So there were all these phases of what you had to d, and the way you do it. It was different for every book.",
,DB:,"When you were working on for Dragon Logic, when you were working on paper in the mornings, what were you working on?  What were your materials?",
,SS:,"A notebook. A pen with wet ink, wettish ink--not the like ballpoint--that has a flow to it. Again because of my hands, I like to have the least effort of writing.  I like big, engineering notebooks with graph papers.  Often, I had bigger ones.  That one had a green graph on it. I don't like just lined pages.  The graph makes an overall page better ...",compgen
,DB:,"It give the page more volume, and Dragon Logic has such interesting volume.  So then how do you save that work? Once you're finished with the notebook, do you store it somewhere or do you send it to an archive?",compgen
,SS:,I ... put it in a box.,compgen
,DB:,So most of your prewriting and your notes are all in notebooks like that?,compgen
,SS:,"You would hope but no, they are not.  There's a lot of loose paper. The writing can be on anything because it's whatever I happen to hold up at that exact moment.  Often it will be notes I wrote down at different times and then have had to bring together.",compgen
,,"There were so many versions for a while. I started drowning in versions and then I got tired of that.  And then came the time when I decided I needed to use the back of everything for ecological reasons.  I really feel sorry for the people that have to look at this later because now there's a version of the work when you look on the back, and you have no idea when that thing on the back was done. If you think of the writing on the back and front were done at the same time, they never were.",compgen
,DB:,"Good then, now we have that on record.",compgen
,SS:,"And they have no relation to each other but I can just see somebody saying they're related because they're on the same paper .... and the other thing I do that's crazy is that I have some notebooks and then sometimes I go through the exact same notebook again and write into it so that it's actually a palimpsest of two different things that happen and there's no way that you would know, from the outside.",compgen
,DB:,Why do you do that?,compgen
,SS:,"Because I go back and see if it still has the pull for me that it did, the things that I wrote down at that time, because there are things that tend to be continually magnetizing for me. I've never kept a diary in the sense of a personal diary or or a diary of what happened with my kids' behavior or whatever.  I've never done that kind of a thing.  I have a horror of that like I have a horror of a blank page, but sometimes, something just gets to me and I need to write it down, so it's magnetizing. Maybe some image or something ....",compgen
,,"I remember seeing once a Viking boat on the cover of a company's annual report or something like that, and it was the keel and the shape of the thing, a kind of turquoise blue. The image had nothing to do with what was in the report but there's this image",
,,"In a zillion ways that was important to me, which I don't necessarily know why, you know.  So I have pictures pulled off like that in the notebooks.  And no, it's not organized.",
,DB:,"Okay, good luck future research.",
[00:15:00],DB:,So how do you organize the individual poems that come out of these notebooks once everything moves on to a digital space?,
,SS:,"I'm really good at that.  I do that for lots of other people's books too.  I see unities, I see structures.  I think I think in structures.  I wanted to be an architect at one time. So I see the sort side of math side of things and the beautiful side of things--the structure is often what I see. So I see that and then the question becomes, ""What's the best way in?"" But that's for print because in a digital work, there's not an 'in' in the same way, right?  There's an access often to all parts of it at once, though I generally provide a default path through as well as more open path.  So I think that's probably why that kind of work is so interesting to me Starting with True North, which has those five poems that are used to divide up the book, but really they are supposed to be at the center of a moving pole, like the sun going around, so ""How do you tell where True North is?"" You're answering that one question and then the rest of the poems would be around in a sort of spherical space. Really, it should be in installation. Or truly three dimensional, which of course you're not going to get, but anyway--",
